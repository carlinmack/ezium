## Installation

From your Hugo site run the following.

```sh
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/carlinmack/ezium.git
```

For more information read the [official setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Configuration

Many configuration features of Ezhil will work but be prepared to dig into the code if they don't. I'm not planning to support features like social media links etc.

```toml
baseURL = "https://example.com/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My personal blog"
theme = "ezium"

```
